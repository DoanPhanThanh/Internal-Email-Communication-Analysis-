🔴 Pressure to engage during off-hours can disrupt work-life balance, leading to burnout and reduced productivity.

## Recommendations:

🟢 Define and communicate clear guidelines for email response expectations during and outside of regular work hours. Foster a culture that respects off-hours and promotes work-life balance.

🟢 Promote best practices for email management, such as setting filters, using folders for categorization, and adopting inbox zero techniques to keep inboxes organized and manageable.

🟢 Offer flexible work arrangements, like staggered hours or remote work options, to accommodate employees’ schedules and reduce pressure to engage with emails during off-hours.

🟢 Encourage employees to disconnect from work emails during non-work hours by emphasizing the importance of taking breaks and allowing uninterrupted personal time.

🟢 Regularly assess the effectiveness of email communication practices and gather employee feedback to make necessary adjustments and improvements.
